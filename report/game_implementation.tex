\section*{Game implementation}
We decided to play the game with 7 different colors and to display the words one by one. The recognizer to be build is then quite easy. It has a short dictionary of only five words and a grammar of only one word by a sentence. Moreover, the probability to appear for each word is the same. Thus, there is no need of building any language model in our case.
